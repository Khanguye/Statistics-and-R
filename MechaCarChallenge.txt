****MPG Regression****

multiple linear regression model
- mile per gallon (mpg) is dependent variable and vehicle length (veh_length), vehicle weight (veh_weight), spoiler angle (spoiler_angle) and ground clearance (grd_clearance) are independent variables

- Coefficient Output:
Coefficients:
  (Intercept)     veh_length     veh_weight  spoiler_angle  grd_clearance  
   -1.076e+02      6.240e+00      1.276e-03      8.031e-02      3.659e+00  

- The model
mpg = 6.240(veh_length) + 0.001(veh_weight) + 0.08(spoiler_angle) + 3.66(grd_clearance) - 107.60

- Statistics Output:
Coefficients:
               Estimate  Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)   -1.076e+02  1.576e+01  -6.823 1.87e-08 ***
veh_length     6.240e+00  6.609e-01   9.441 3.05e-12 ***
veh_weight     1.277e-03  6.948e-04   1.837   0.0728 .  
spoiler_angle  8.031e-02  6.656e-02   1.207   0.2339    
grd_clearance  3.659e+00  5.394e-01   6.784 2.13e-08 ***

- According to above results, vehicle length (veh_length) and ground clearance (grd_clearance) as well as intercept are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words, the vehicle length and the ground clearance have a significant impact on the mile per gallon of Vehicle. Therefore, the slope of the linear is not considered zero.
- This linear model predict the mile per gallon of MechaCar prototypes is somehow effectively becuase we can see the correlation with the vehicle length and the ground clearance factors. However, becuase the dataset is small, we do not see the correlation with the vehicle weight and the spoiler angle factors yet. I would like to keep these factors in the dataset and continue to collect more data so we can analysis again when the dataset is large enough.

****Suspension Coil Summary****
- Table Output

Mean     median  variance   std
1498.78  1500    62.29356   7.892627

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Base on the result, the variance is 62.29 or the standard deviation is 7.89 while the design specification variance is 100 or standard deviation is 10. It looks like the manufacturing data meet the design specification, but we need to look into the normality of the manufacturing data before making the decision. The mean is 1498.78 and median is 1500 so the normality of the suspension coils is the skew left or negative skewed. However, they are very close together. Therefore, The manufacturing data meet the design specification because at least 70% suspensions will meet the design specification within the variance 100 pounds per inch from the central the mean or the median 1500

****Suspension Coil T-Test****
- Test Output

One Sample t-test
data:  (Suspension_Coil_sample_table$PSI)
t = 0.79784, df = 49, p-value = 0.4288
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1498.78
95 percent confidence interval:
 1497.504 1501.736
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1499.62 
  
- Based on the result, we can see that the p-value is 0.4288 is greater than 0.05 and the mean of the sample is 1499.62 is very close to the mean population. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject that the manufacturing data meet the design specification.


****MPG vs AWD****
Is there any statistical different in the Mile per Gallon of MechaCar base on its All Wheel Drive?
H0: The same statistical output mile per gallon base on wheel drive
HA: At lease one type not the same statistical output mile per gallon base on wheel drive
-OUT PUT
Terms:
                      AWD Residuals
Sum of Squares    238.479 11643.688
Deg. of Freedom         1        48

Residual standard error: 15.57488

            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
AWD          1    238   238.5   0.983  0.326
Residuals   48  11644   242.6               

- Based on the result, we can see the Pr(>F) or P-value is 0.326 is greater that 0.05 significance level so we do not have sufficicent evidence to reject the MPG vs AWD statistical different.

Is there any statistical different in the Mile per Gallon of Other Cars base on its All Wheel Drive?
-OUT PUT
Terms:
                     drv Residuals
Sum of Squares  1732.935  1319.841
Deg. of Freedom        2        73

Residual standard error: 4.25206
Estimated effects may be unbalanced
            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)    
drv          2   1733   866.5   47.92 5.1e-14 ***
Residuals   73   1320    18.1                  
- Based on the result, we can see the Pr(>F) or P-value is 5.1e-14 is smaller that 0.05 significance level so we have sufficicent evidence to reject the mile per gallon vs wheel drive statiscal different. Or there are one type of wheel drive statistical different with the rest.

- Base on the two ANOVA analysis, we can see that MechaCar prototype give out the consistence statistical data or the Mechacar is more stable output on Mile per gallon base on Wheel drive when we compare data to the other cars.
